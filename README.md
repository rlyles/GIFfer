Have you ever wanted to find a very specific GIF, probably of David from Schitt's Creek making a super-particular face? Ever wanted to do that bad enough to make a Windows program that would do it for you? Well now you don't have to, but you certainly can.
1. Install, quick & painless
2. GIFs from USER/Downloads will be yoinked to USER/Documents/GIFfer/gifs
3. Yoinked GIFs will be added to the GIFfer gif repository, where you can tag your many gifs at your leisure
4. Minimize to tray for constant GIFfing

TBD: system-wide contextual menu implementation, determining if there is an upper limit to how many GIFs one can really need
